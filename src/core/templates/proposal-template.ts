const proposalSteps = `**Steps**
1. Run \`lightspec list\` and \`lightspec list --specs\`, and inspect related code or docs (e.g., via \`rg\`/\`ls\`) to ground the proposal in current behaviour.
2. Note any gaps in the user plan that require clarification. Ask follow-up questions to resolve ambiguities before proceeding. Avoid making assumptions about unstated requirements or implementation details.
3. Choose a unique verb-led \`change-id\` and scaffold \`proposal.md\`, \`tasks.md\`, and \`design.md\` (when needed) under \`lightspec/changes/<id>/\`.
4. Map the change into concrete capabilities or requirements, breaking multi-scope efforts into distinct spec deltas with clear relationships and sequencing.
5. Capture architectural reasoning in \`design.md\` when the solution spans multiple systems, introduces new patterns, or demands trade-off discussion before committing to specs.
6. Draft spec deltas in \`changes/<id>/specs/<capability>/spec.md\` (one folder per capability) using \`## ADDED|MODIFIED|REMOVED Requirements\` with at least one \`#### Scenario:\` per requirement and cross-reference related capabilities when relevant.
7. Draft \`tasks.md\` as an ordered list of small, verifiable work items that deliver user-visible progress, include validation (tests, tooling), and highlight dependencies or parallelizable work.
8. Validate with \`lightspec validate <id> --strict --no-interactive\` and resolve every issue before sharing the proposal.`;

const proposalReferences = `**Reference**
- Use \`lightspec show <id> --json --deltas-only\` or \`lightspec show <spec> --type spec\` to inspect details when validation fails.
- Search existing requirements with \`rg -n "Requirement:|Scenario:" lightspec/specs\` before writing new ones.
- Explore the codebase with \`rg <keyword>\`, \`ls\`, or direct file reads so proposals align with current implementation realities.
- If rg is unavailable, use platform-native search tools and suggest installing rg for efficient proposal development.`;
